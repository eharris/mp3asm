Changelog for mp3asm:
---------------------

Todo:
 - flags for changing headers
 - add/remove crc
 - fading
 - implement Xing vbr header
 - implement id3 v2
 - link it to mpglib & alsa
 - gtk frontend

0.1.3: (19/08/01)
------
	quick lame stuff
        - found a crced file; mp3asm now strips out the crc
        - no longer halts on bad backrefs, writes empty dsize ->frame removed
        - no longer loops on id3v2tags that are at the start of the stream

0.1.2: (22/03/01)
------
        - cleanin up process stream
	- removed remove_dead_frames, remove_prev_frames,
	  remove_next_frames
	  they became obsolete due to process_frames
	- writing merge streams
	- unified headers implemented
	- cleaned up output + a few bugs

0.1.1: (19/03/01)
------
	- removed dependency of glib, guint8 = unsigned char
	- implementing the standard configure
	- parsing now uses callbacks
	- standard vbr apparently worked all the time!!!!
	- implemented advanced header search
	  u know those files where some brainless kid just deleted
	  bytes till he stopped hearing the blip or whatever...
	  well, mp3asm can now take that mp3 and pour it in a decent
	  shape. 
	- reads id3 v1 tag
	- writes id3 v1 tag
	- correctly calculates avg br

0.1.0:
------
	- Parsing commandline should be somewhat ok
	- The cyclic buffer implementation seems to be workling nicely
	- layer 3 streams seem to load.
	- layer 2 too :)
	- writing stream works np
	- can cut frames from a stream 	

0.0.1:
------
Olli Fromme's magnificent idea ended abruptly in october of '97.
More than 3ys before some wanker realised that mp3 files r a sequence of
frames, and that it should be possible to edit at frame level and in the
end stumbled over this lil gem. Although it worked on just a few files it
was way ahead of its time :) Too bad olli didnt continue development.

So this would be a fair judgement:
 
Almost working, counts on an empty frame to exist in the stream.
Pretty nifty, too bad it was almost forgotten.
Prolly, no not prolly, it just plainly is the most usefull mp3 tool ive
ever seen.
